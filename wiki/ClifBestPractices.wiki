#summary This page summarizes best practices for creating logical theories, ontologies and knowledge-bases using CLIF.

=== Item 1: === ==== Avoid unnamed texts ====

ISO 24707 allows for both named and unnamed texts (see section A.2.3.11).  However, unnamed texts cannot be referenced outside of their own scope and are not generally useful when constructing ontologies from modular components ().  It is therefore recommended that all CL texts be named using an appropriate identifier ([ClifBestPractices#Item_3:_Use_URNs_to_name_things see Item 3]).
